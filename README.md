# 🌐 EnergiSuite
A comprehensive full-stack arbitrage tool. 

## 📝 Introduction
This is currently a work in progress as I find time in the evenings and weekends to work on this. As of 2/21/2024, the actual 'workhorse' script that actually gets the prices and scrapes them, is completed.

## 🎯 Goals
1. Create UI/executable to be run locally on PC. Image below is work in progress.
* UI will include:
  1. Editable list of coins to check against. -> Completed!
  2. Adjustable search parameters -> Completed!
  
 2. After the UI executable is completed, begin work on website that will operate much like the executable, but will be run on a server instead of locally. Website will feature graphs of profit opportunites over time for (again) an adjustable list of coins.

## Current Functionality
90% of UI works, only missing functionality is auto run execution mode and a popup when a target is found.
