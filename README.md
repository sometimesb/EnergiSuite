# üåê Energi Suite
A third iteration of the energi reaper bot that I built. Second version used to much RAM because it used selenium. Can now be run on a server and even headless.

## üìù Introduction
This Python script functions as a cryptocurrency monitoring bot, leveraging various libraries and APIs to perform comprehensive analyses. It operates in two distinct modes: CoinGecko and USD. In CoinGecko mode, the bot compares cryptocurrency prices between EnergiSwap and CoinGecko. Conversely, in USD mode, it focuses on analyzing price differentials among selected stablecoins.

I put a lot of work into this bot and it made me 40x my initial investment at its peak :)

This uses _EnergiSwap_ (a fork of UniSwap).

## üîß Technologies Used
* Python - Main driver of the script
* Batch - executes script for the user

*No more* Selenium!

## üìô Libraries and Versions Used
* python             3.11.4
* botasaurus         3.2.24
* customtkiner       5.2.2
* pillow             10.2.0

## ü§î Why is this the third version of the same core code?
It actually isn't the same core code! The first version was spaghetti code, the second uses functions + selenium for webscraping. This new version removes selenium entirely.
Requests library cannot be used as the energiswap API uses cloudflare and blocks robot requests...as an API. 

Yes, I know. So you must use botasaurus in stealth mode.

*Memory usage factor is rough approximation of watching total memory usage across the programs*

|  | Memory Usage Factor | Speed |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Version 1 | 3 | 60s |
| EnergiReaperReborn | 3 | 3s |
| EnergiSuite | 1 | 0.25s |


## üöÄ Functionality
The UI boasts an easy to use screen. Immediately, you can decide what mode you want to run in.
1. USD Mode -> USDC, DAI, USDE, etc.

3. Allows you to set custom search parameters, what kind of profit % do we need to search for? This is used as a minimum, anything below the minimum will not be shown in the textbox.

4. API Limiter detection. Tells you when coingecko OR energiswap API blocks you.

5. Modular JSON file that allows you to add and remove cryptocurrencies as you desire.
```JSON
{
  "NAME_ID_MAPPING_CRYPTO_MODE": {
    "Ether": ["ethereum","ETH"],
    "Bitcoin": ["bitcoin","BTC"]
  },
  "NAME_ID_MAPPING_USD_MODE": {
    "Energi Dollar": ["energi-dollar","USDE"],
    "Dai Stablecoin": ["dai","DAI"]
  }
}
```
## üìÑ Full rundown & Installation:
1) Must install libraries with specific versions above. Special emphasis on the discord version, or it will not work.
2) Head to config.json, you must follow this specific format.
```
"Crypto Name": ["ID in coingecko", "Symbol"]
```
3. Run Main.py, UI will automatically open.
4. Profit
