# 🌐 EnergiSuite
A comprehensive full-stack arbitrage tool. 

## 📝 Introduction
This is currently a work in progress as I find time in the evenings and weekends to work on this. As of 2/21/2024, the actual 'workhorse' script that actually gets the prices and scrapes them, is completed.

## 🎯 Goals
1. Create UI/executable to be run locally on PC. This will mean a UI similar to that of CustomTkinter, and should look similar to that of below.
* Feature plan is to include a login system (free to signup), which will use DB to save login/signups.
* UI will include:
  1. Editable list of coins to check against
  2. Adjustable search parameters
  3. Icons if time allows.
  4. Login/Signup

 2. After the UI executable is completed, begin work on website that will operate much like the executable, but will be run on a server instead of locally. Website will feature graphs of profit opportunites over time for (again) an adjustable list of coins.

## Current Functionality
'Workhorse' script is completed, and is seen below. Will scrape for both assets, map the data, and outputs the coin, its ID in coingecko, and a price difference as seen below. Python UI will call this script as needed.
